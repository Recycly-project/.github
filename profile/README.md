## 📜 **About Recycly** 📜

Indonesia struggles with a major plastic waste problem, contributing significantly to global pollution due to poor waste management and low public awareness. Recycly offers a smart solution by integrating machine learning (ML), mobile development (MD), and cloud computing (CC) to classify plastic bottles into three categories: damaged, recyclable (without caps and labels), full bottles (with caps and labels), and non-bottle items.  This system promotes efficient recycling, encourages proper disposal through user rewards, and supports Indonesia’s goal to cut plastic waste by 70% by 2025, driving sustainable waste management practices. 

## 🚀 **MVP Features** 🚀

- **Plastic Bottle Classification**:  AI-powered classification of plastic bottles into four categories:
  1. **Damaged Bottles** : Bottles that are crushed or broken and not suitable for recycling.
  2. **Recyclable Bottles** : Bottles that are clean and free from caps or labels, ready for recycling.
  3. **Full Bottles** : Bottles with caps and labels that need to be properly processed before recycling.
  4. **Non-Bottles** : Items that are not plastic bottles and are excluded from the recycling process.

- **Reward System** 🎁: Users earn points for properly disposing of their bottles. This encourages sustainable behavior and promotes recycling.

- **Mobile App** 📱: An Android app that allows users to scan and categorize plastic bottles. The app connects to the backend system in real-time and allocates points for proper bottle disposal.
